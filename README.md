# Flatiron School Project 3
## Top 5 Zipcodes for Real Estate Investment in Oregon


### Description
This repository contains files from a project assigned to me as part of Flatiron School's Online Data Science Bootcamp. The purpose of the project is to demonstrate skills in time series modeling.

Here's what you'll find inside:
- **kreiger-fs-project-3.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing project code
- **kreiger-fs-project-3.html**: the above Jupyter Notebook but in HTML, so you can more easily view it in your browser
- **zillow_data.csv** CSV file containing main dataset from Zillow
- **zillow_listings_counts.csv**: CSV file containing additional data from Zillow
- **presentation.pdf**: PDF file containing slides from a non-technical presentation of project results

### Technical specifications
I created the Jupyter Notebook in a virtual environment provided to me by Flatiron School. Things may work a little differently for you if you're running different versions of Python or the packages I used.

If you download the notebook to view locally, note that I formatted it using Jupyter Notebook extensions (https://github.com/ipython-contrib/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions). The extensions let me easily create a table of contents and collapse groups of cells to make the notebook easier to read and navigate. If you don't have the extensions installed locally, the notebook will look a little different for you.

In addition to Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, you will also need Facebook Prophet to run the notebook on your local machine.

### Authorship
Flatiron School provided me the main dataset, and a starter notebook with two helper functions that I changed to suit my purposes. I wrote the rest of the code in the Jupyter Notebook, the text of this README, my blog post linked above, and the content of my non-technical presentation.
